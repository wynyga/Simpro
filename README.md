## Why Laravel?
Laravel is a powerful and elegant Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework for building web applications in PHP. We chose Laravel for this project because it significantly streamlines development and offers several key advantages:
Robust Security Features: Laravel comes with built-in security features that protect against common web vulnerabilities, making it an excellent choice for an application that handles sensitive data like user accounts and financial transactions.
Scalability: Its modular and organized structure makes it easy to add new features and handle increasing user loads as the project grows.
Developer-Friendly Tools: Laravel provides a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries that simplify common tasks, such as routing, database management, and authentication, which speeds up the development process without sacrificing quality.
Clean and Maintainable Code: By enforcing the MVC pattern, Laravel helps maintain a clear separation of concerns, resulting in code that is easy to read, debug, and maintain over time.
